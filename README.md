# Simulated-Annealing-for-NP-hard-problems
Since this is an academic project for pure purposes of research, the code is not optimized to be very user friendly. Please bear with the details

Provide path for the Dimacs file in "/src/SAT.java". Navigate to the "path" variable in "SAT" class.	
Control annealing schedule in main() in the switch case.

The code is written to start recognizing the 3-SAT equation from line 11. Links to various dimacs file for 3-SAT equations are provided below:

For more extensive research, run the code on a supercomputer with "MAX_TRIES" and "MAX_FLIPS" variable as stated in this paper: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.53.9290&rep=rep1&type=pdf
